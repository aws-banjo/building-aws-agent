## Agent AWS
Agent AWS is an automated, AI-powered agent that uses HuggingFace Transformers paired with numerous different foundation models.

An “agent” here is a large language model (LLM) equipped with a prompt and access to a specific set of tools. 
Tools are self-contained functions that perform a singular task that the agent can use when given an instruction.

Agent AWS contains a set of tools that allows it to query AWS documentation, generating code, and creating architectural diagrams.
